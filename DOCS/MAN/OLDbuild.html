<h3>NOTE:</h3>
Unlike Version 1.0, ZEUS-MP Version 2 <b>REQUIRES A FORTRAN 90
COMPILER.</b>
<h3>The Tar File Directory Tree</h3>
Upon untarring the tar file, the user will see a top-level directory
named
"zeusmp2". Under zeusmp2 are 4 subdirectories:
<ul>
  <li> src90: containing all ZEUS-MP source code files and Makefiles </li>
  <li> exe90: containing the zeusmp.x executable (once built), input
file(s) required for execution, and any output files produced. </li>
  <li> test: containing input data decks for some example test problems
  </li>
  <li> pp: containing a minimal post-processing code for concatenating
local output files written by each processor.
<!--   <LI> MGLIB: containing the compiled MGMPI library (once built). --></li>
</ul>
<br>
<b><font size="4">Customizing the Makefile</font></b><br>
<p>
To compile ZEUS-MP, one needs to have a copy of "Makefile" in place in
the
src90 subdirectory. A sophisticated Makefile-building script is not
currently
in place, although one may be offered in a future release. Two currently
valid example Makefiles are provided in the 2.0.0 tarball.  <b>Makefile.sdsc.datastar</b>
is valid on <a href="http://www.npaci.edu/DataStar" target="dstar">DataStar</a>
at the <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu" target="sdsc">San Diego Supercomputing
Center</a>. <b>Makefile.nersc.seaborg</b> is valid on 
<a href="http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/SP/">Seaborg</a> at
<a href="http://www.nersc.gov">National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center</a>.
To create a working Makefile on your machine, use one of the provided Makefiles
as a template and edit the following environment variables set in the
Makefile: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>ZMP_EXE -- The relative path of the zeusmp.x executable. </li>
  <li>ZMP_CPP -- Contains CPP macros used to configure the code. </li>
  <li>ZMP_FC -- The name of the Fortran 90 compiler. </li>
  <li>ZMP_CC -- The name of the C compiler. </li>
  <li>ZMP_MOD -- The relative path to the directory containing the
".mod" F90 module objects generated during compilation of the ZEUS
fortran routines. </li>
  <li>ZMP_OPTS -- Fortran compiler options. </li>
  <li>ZMP_LIB -- The absolute path to system libraries (e.g. HDF4). </li>
  <li>ZMP_LDR -- The command invoked to link the object files.
</ul>

Including MGMPI<br>
</font></b><br>
ZEUS-MP supports the use of the MGMPI elliptic linear system solver for
the solution of Poisson's equation for problems that include
self-gravity on 3D Cartesian meshes with non-periodic boundary
conditions. The use of MGMPI in ZEUS-MP is enabled at compilation time
by including the string, "-DUSE_MGMPI" in the ZMP_CPP definition line.
In this case, the loader will look in the src90 subdirectory for a
binary file called "libdmgmpi.a" This file is not included in the
ZEUS-MP distribution, but rather must be built separately from the
MGMPI source code, which may be obtained <a
 href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/mgmpi/" target="mgmpi">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
If MGMPI is not used (USE_MGMPI is left undefined), then ZEUS-MP will
default to the 3D conjugate gradient linear solver for 3D non-periodic
meshes. Current (November 2005) research suggests that MGMPI will
perform better than the CG solver once the mesh size exceeds 256<sup>3</sup>.
<br>
<p>
</p>
<b><font size="4">The FFTw Gravity Solver Libraries</font></b><br>
<br>
Compiling the code with the FFTw solver enabled requires that the Makefile
be edited such that:
<ol>
   <li> The string <b>-DFFT</b> be appended to the <b>ZMP_CPP</b>
        definition.</li>
   <li> C routines <b>fftw_ps.c</b> and <b>fftw_plan.c</b> be included
        in the COBJ file list.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Makefile.sdsc.datastar</b> provides an example of a Makefile properly
configured to include the needed ZEUS-MP source files and the system
library files on Datastar.  <b>Makefile.nersc.seaborg</b> is written with
all FFT references eliminated and thus provides a template for machines
on which the FFTw libraries are absent.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Compilation</h3>
With a proper Makefile, the command <b>make compile</b> is used to
compile the code (<b>gmake</b> may also be used). During compilation,
each fortran file with
a ".F" suffix is processed by the C preprocessor, which generates a
corresponding file with a ".f" suffix. These processed files are then
used to create object files which are subsequently linked into the
executable.
<p><b> Desired changes to any subroutine must be applied to the ".F"
copy of that routine.</b>
</p>
<h3>Comments:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The primary use of the C preprocessor is to expose/hide sections
of the
code
to/from the compiler. The majority of macros defined in the ZMP_CPP
variable
pertain to MPI, and they are easily identified since "MPI" appears in
the
character string of each macro. Leaving "-DMPI_USED" out of the ZMP_CPP
macro
line causes all MPI code to be hidden from the compiler; in this way
ZEUS-MP
can be compiled as a serial code on systems which don't have MPI. </li>
  <li>The name of the subroutines which handle initialization specific
to the problem
and restarting a run for that particular problem are specified by the
"PROBLEM"
and "PROBRES" CPP macros, respectively. For example, to run the sod
shock test
included with the code, your ZMP_CPP line must include "-DPROBLEM=sod"
and would
also include "-DPROBRES=sodres" in the unlikely event that you need to
continue
the Sod test from a restart file. </li>
  <li>The MGMPI multigrid Poisson solver is available as a separate
package
from the <a href="http://cosmos.ucsd.edu/mgmpi/" target="mgmpi">MGMPI Web page.</a>
It must be built as a separate library and included in the link path if
it
is to be used. When building ZEUS-MP, all references to MGMPI can be
hidden from the compiler by leaving the "USE_MGMPI" CPP macro
undefined,
so it is not necessary to download MGMPI to use ZEUS-MP.</li>
</ul>
